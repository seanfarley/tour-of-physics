One-dimensional motion
======================

We want to understand the meanings of time, `distance
<http://www.alcyone.com/max/physics/orders/metre.html>`_, speed, velocity, and
acceleration. We all have some experience with motion but, as for many aspects
of daily life, we have a somewhat vague notion of this common event. We have
all driven from our home to a friend's house but we never had any reason to get
our rulers and stopwatches to carefully quantify motion beyond our relative
words of fast and slow, moving or stopped. As we measure specific aspects of
nature, we are always surprised that it is not exactly what we had assumed. We
are surprised by the results of measurements. Science means "facts and
understandings obtained from repeatable measurements-billions of measurements
have been made." These are the most important points of the course.

CQ: Write on a sheet of paper to turn in at the end of the class time. Take 15
seconds to answer each of the following questions. What sort of things have you
seen in motion? Which things can you see moving right now? Describe "distance."
How much time elapses between heartbeats? How much time is spent shaking your
head? Describe something you can do in 1 second. In 10. In 100. For how long
does a thrown ball stay in the air? How long does it take you to walk up a
flight of stairs? How long does it take a car to traverse a highway on-ramp?
How long does it take a rock dropped from shoulder-height to hit the ground?
How long will a horizontally-shot bullet stay in the air? Do you believe that
the dropped rock and fired bullet both take the same amount of time to fall to
the ground? Nature surprises us. We will be surprised in every chapter. In this
chapter, we will refine our notion of motion.


Imagine for a moment a world in which nothing is moving-no cars, trains, or
planes in motion, not even a strolling animal or a bush blowing in the wind.
Just 150 years ago-before we developed engines for trains and such-very few
objects were in motion besides people and animals. Since it is only living
things that can move themselves of their own accord, about the only other
objects in motion were the wind, rising smoke, rivers, clouds, and falling
rain. Ask tribes-people why clouds move and they might answer "Because that's
what they like to do." This makes sense to me. When our earliest natural
philosophers pondered the nature of motion, they had only the motions of these
few objects to explain. Empedocles (490 - 430 BCE) and Aristotle (384 - 322
BCE) explained these motions in terms of things seeking their own level in
matter's hierarchy of water, earth, air, fire, and heavens.

CQ: Do stars, comets, and planets move? Can you think of other things that
move? Do they move of their own accord?

They also asked what is it that temporarily keeps a rock moving after you have
thrown it. How would you explain it? Our first moving machinery-sailboats and
grinding mills, for example-were pushed or pulled by people, animals, wind, or
water. They moved only as something else pushed them. Back around the year
1850, the first time people saw a train moving under its own power they
typically said that they were astonished because "It moved just like a living
thing." Before the train, only living things could move under their own power.
We are constantly in motion today, driving around town and flying around the
continents, but just a couple centuries ago, a busy city was filled only with
foot traffic and some horse- or people-drawn carts. The city contained only
motionless buildings. In this Wisconsin Historical Society photo, foot traffic
in an otherwise motionless city is seen as people walk to work at a Chicago
factory in 1886. Copy the following URL into your browser to see the caption

By the way, animals are naturally equipped to detect the motion of other
objects because such movement often is of biological consequence. We also
quickly learn to ignore those motions which are of no biological consequence,
such as the swaying of grass in the wind, though we still might still enjoy
such a sight in a mountain meadow. But our animal senses are easily fooled.
Akiyoshi Kitaoka from the Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan demonstrates
that sometimes motion is just an illusion. Motion is also art in interactive
exhibits, movement, dance, and in kinetic sculptures. Motion can be frozen in
time.

Motion is a fundamental aspect of nature, but what exactly is the nature of
motion? While driving your car past trees and such, has it ever seemed to you
that you are motionless and that instead it is the objects outside the car that
are moving past you? From your point of view, are you in motion or are the
passing tress and such in motion?

CQ: Are or are not those trees in motion?

Motion involves relative movement. While driving your car for example, you and
your passengers are not in motion relative to each other but you are in motion
relative to the ground, less so relative to other cars you pass, and about
twice so relative to oncoming cars.

Can you be in motion without knowing it? You may have noticed that if you close
your eyes while riding in a car, you are unaware of the car's constant speed
but do sense its changes in motion (termed "acceleration"). We feel the
acceleration as the car seat pushes us forward. We also feel acceleration as an
elevator begins moving and later slows to a stop. But without sensing it at
all, we are in motion as the Earth spins in its daily cycle and travels in its
annual path around the Sun; at the same time, the Solar System orbits the
center of the galaxy, and the galaxies are moving away from each other within
the expanding universe. How would you quantify motion?

The motion experiments of Galileo
---------------------------------

Galileo was among the first persons to experimentally study motion. His work
began to reveal to us the true nature of motion. He is the hero of this
chapter. Galileo (1564-1642) and Shakespeare were both born in the same year.
(This is also the year that Michelangelo died.) Some 78 years later, Galileo
died during the same year that Newton was born (not fig Newton but Isaac
Newton, who is the hero of the next chapter).

Around the year 1590, Galileo 2 began to quantify motion by measuring the time
needed for rolling balls to travel given distances along tilted pathways or
inclined planes. The steeper the incline, the faster the balls will travel. At
the time, there were variously named units of distance-cubits and leagues, for
example-and the day had been divided into twenty-four hours but no clocks yet
existed that counted the tiny intervals we call seconds. The day was divided
only into morning, noon, afternoon, and evening and such. Galileo made his
measurements of motion before second-hands existed on clocks. He measured time
intervals by counting heartbeats, water drops, and pendulum swings. By the way,
what causes the oscillatory motion of a pendulum?

Dropped objects take only a fraction of a second to fall to the ground; it is
hard to time such a short interval by counting fractions of heartbeats. Galileo
used inclined planes to stretch the time duration of the motion. The less steep
the incline, the longer will be the duration of the motion.

Speed represents a distance traveled divided by the time taken to travel that
distance. For a modern example, driving at 60 mph means that we traverse a
distance of 60 miles in one hour. Galileo quantified motion in terms of
distance traversed in each of a series of, for example, three-heartbeat time
units. That is, what distance was covered in the first three-heartbeat time
period and what distance was covered in the second three-heartbeat time period,
and the third, and so on. Galileo defined acceleration to be the change in
speed per unit time. (While driving our car, we say that we press the
accelerator to speed up.)

CQ: Suppose you begin from a stopped position to drive down a highway on-ramp,
you traverse a small distance during the first three-heartbeat time unit (write
down an estimate of this distance), a larger distance through the next
three-heartbeat time unit (write down an estimate of this distance), and a yet
larger distance through the next (write down an estimate of this distance) as
your speed increases from slow to fast and then faster.

Galileo found that as a ball rolls down an inclined plane, its speed increases
linearly in time -- it is accelerating -- but its position increases as the
square of time. Mathematically, these are written :math:`v \propto t` and
:math:`x \propto t^2`. Using the letter 'a' as the constant of proportionality,
these two relations are also written :math:`v = at` and :math:`x = \frac{1}{2}
at^2`.

CQ: Would you have guessed before making these measurements that nature behaves
in this specific, mathematical way? Would you expect nature to behave in a
mathematical way in any situation?

Luckily, these speed and acceleration equations hold no matter what object-from
wooden spheres to metal cylinders-rolls down the inclined plane. They also hold
whether the incline is set nearly horizontal or completely vertical, which then
results in "free-fall" motion. In the year 1632, Galileo published his results
in Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences. Before Galileo, nobody had stumbled
across the importance of the time rate of change of speed. Galileo quantified
the change in speed, which is acceleration, :math:`a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t_f -
t_i} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt}`. We will use the Greek letter
delta for the symbol to represent "change." It is always the "final minus
initial" values. Just a few decades later, Isaac Newton would build upon
Galileo's work to figure out that forces cause accelerations.

What other sorts of natural phenomena might be describable by an equation? The
answer is: all of them. We find out more accurately how nature works when we
make measurements and discover the equations that describe those measurements.
This is the goal of the physicist. Every scientist is seeking the "mother
load," which is to be the first person to understand a newly-found aspect of
nature. Each new understanding clears up previous confusion and opens new doors
of inquiry. Remember also that nature nearly always has more imagination then
us, we rarely predict ahead of time how nature behaves: we instead go measure
nature and are surprised by the result. Science means facts and understandings
obtained from repeatable measurements-billions of measurements have been made.
These are the most important points of the course.

Lets look one-by-one at distance, time, speed, and acceleration. A goal of this
chapter is for us to gain an understanding of the physical meaning of speed and
acceleration.

Time
----

Time is measured in seconds. We sometimes count seconds by counting out loud:
"one thousand, two thousand." The time that elapses between heartbeats is about
three-fourths seconds.

Lifetimes typically last for about one billion heart beats, no matter the
species or heart rate. In general, the larger the animal, the slower the heart
rate. Small animals having heart rates ten times the human rate and have
lifetimes that are one-tenth as long as a human's lifetime.

Example:
How many seconds are in a year?

.. math::

   \frac{60sec}{min} \cdot \frac{60min}{hour} \cdot \frac{24hours}{day} \cdot
   \frac{365days}{year}

When estimating calculations, a year has about :math:`\pi \times 10^7` seconds.

Example:
How many years are there in a billion seconds?

:math:`\frac{10^9 s}{3.15 \times 10^7 \frac{sec}{year}} = 31.7` years.

The age of the Earth is 4.5 billion years or :math:`1.5 \times 10^{17}`
seconds, and the age of the universe is 13 billion years or :math:`4 \times
10^{17}` seconds.

CQ: What is the duration of the trajectory of this tossed item? For how many
seconds have you lived?
