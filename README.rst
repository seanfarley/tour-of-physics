Tour of Physics
===============

The standard, introductory physics course and textbook begin the year with
differential calculus and then add integral calculus in the middle of the year.
This book uses integral-calculus from the start. This one-semester shift in
math preparation enables the inclusion of many topics that physics majors learn
in their second, third, and fourth years of college. This book contains a great
number of worked examples, contains examples from everyday life, links to
simulations and animations that bring the equations to life, and includes
advanced topics such as Lagrangian mechanics, quantum mechanics, chaos, and
special functions to prepare students for advanced physics courses. The linked
usage of Wolframalpha.com enables students to work more like a physicist, solve
more-advanced problems, and encounter special functions and such. To prepare
for a career in physics, it is more important, for example, to encounter
Fourier Transforms and Bessel Functions than AC circuits or even the numerous
and minor effects that have been accumulating in introductory physics textbooks
driven by publisher wars. This tour is instead meant to accomplish a greater
depth of study.
